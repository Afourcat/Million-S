# Million-S
particle library in CSFML written in C and waiting for the implementation in C++

## Features
- [X] Basic system
- [X] Speed and position
- [X] Shader handling
- [X] Infinite system
- [X] Little API
- [ ] Re-implementation in C++
- [ ] Optimisations
- [ ] Orientation and dispertion
- [ ] Tests

## Test
Right now the library is only usable as executable.
I will add a rule to the Makefile to compile in lib.

if you want gdb or something:
      
    $> make debug

otherwise.

    $> make
    
To compile the test binary then:

    $> ./particle
